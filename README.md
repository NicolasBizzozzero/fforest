## TODO
* Find an english name for the package
* Implement the 'guess' option for the parameter --keep-header with the help of this code snippet : https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Sniffer.has_header
* Add more messages related to the verbosity
* Add some progress bars with the package : https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar2
* Rewrite all path processing code with the package : https://pypi.python.org/pypi/path.py
* Save each directory path in the `env` module
* Save each database path in the `env` module
* Implement other format for the input database (each format must be changed to the CSV format during the preprocessing phase)
* The identifier is not a number, it must be quoted during the preprocessing phase
